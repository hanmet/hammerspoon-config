This is my config for [hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) to control windows with a keyboard.

## Setup

```
CMD + CTRL + UP     = window fills the full screen

CMD + CTRL + LEFT  = window fills the left size of the screen

CTRL + ALT + LEFT = window moves to screen 2
CTRL + ALT + RIGHT = window moves to screen 1
